     <h3 style="text-align:center;">palolem beach,Goa</h3>
     <p id="matter">Palolem Beach - is also known as "Paradise Beach" located in South Goa. This beach is about a mile long and it provides seclusion and idyllic scenery. This beach in Goa is not very developed in terms of tourism. So if you are planning to stay over at Palolem Goa, then you may find yourself residing in some huts, enjoying a simple way of living. The best time to visit Palolem Beach is November to March. This stretch of white sand dominates the southern coast of Goa.Although a few developments have taken place, the beach still has a soothing aura to it. A large area of the beach now accomodates a lot of small shacks that taper off as you move towards the south. Dolphin cruises and the fishing trips are the other popular attractions. These are offered at quite a reasonable rate. Accomodation is easily available here. Though there are a couple of money exchange centres, Palolem does not have any banks. The closest railway station is at Canacona, which is just 3 km away from Palolem. There are also a lot of buses that ply from Margao to Canacona. From there taxis and local buses are easily available.</p>
