  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Lauterbrunnen Valley,Switzerland</h3>
  <p id="matter">
    The very name ‘Lauter Brunnen’ (‘many fountains’) suggests the magnificence of this landscape. There are 72 waterfalls in the Lauterbrunnen Valley, the most famous being the Staubbach Falls. Plunging almost 300 metres from an overhanging rock face, they are one of the highest free-falling waterfalls in Europe. In 1779, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe visited the valley, and was inspired by the roaring waters to write his well-known poem ‘Spirit song over the waters’ 

Another deafening natural phenomenon are the Trümmelbach Falls in the ‘Black Monk’ mountain, hidden behind mighty rock faces. Up to 20,000 litres of water per second cascade over the ten glacier falls from a total height of about 200 metres. This spectacle can only be reached in summer by tunnel lift.</p>
<p id="matter">
  The expansive ski regions of Wengen-Kleine Scheidegg and Mürren-Schilthorn are quickly reached by mountain railway. There are 45 transport facilities altogether in the Jungfrau region as well as 213 km of piste, fun parks, 100 km of winter hiking trails and 50 km of toboggan run. The Lauterbrunnen Valley also boasts plenty of cross-country ski trails.</p>
